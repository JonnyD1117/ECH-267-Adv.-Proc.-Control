\section*{Problem 1.1}


The first task is to check whether the \textbf{\underline{unforced}} system is stable.

$$
\dot{x} = -x^3
$$

\noindent Where $V(x) = .5x^2$, such that $\dot{V} = x\dot{x}$. By plugging in the state equation we get...

$$
\dot{V}(x) = -x^4
$$

\noindent Obviously, the candidate function is positive definite and radially unbounded while the Lyapunov function is negative definite. Therefore the \underline{unforced} system is \textbf{Globally Asymptotically Stable}.

\noindent Now we can look at the forced behavior of the system given by


$$
\dot{x} = -(1 + u)x^3
$$

\noindent Where $V(x) = .5x^2$, such that $\dot{V} = x\dot{x}$. By plugging in the state equation we get...

$$
\dot{V}(x) = -(1 + u)x^4
$$

\noindent It is clear from observation that, the system is stable \textbf{only} so long as the inputs to the system are bounded above $u \geq -1$. When this bounded is obvserved the system is \textbf{locally ISS}.
