Given the set $S = \{x \in \R^2 | -1 < x_{i} \leq 1, i = 1,2\}$.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The set S is not open since it does not contain all of it's limit points. This is due to the lack of equality on the negative bound of $x_i$.
    \item The closure of set S is the set $\bar{S} = S \cup \{ Limit Points \}$. Which is defined as ...\\  $\bar{S} = \{ x\in \R^2 | -1 \leq x_{i} \leq 1, i = 1,2 \}$

    \item $ S_{interior}$ are all of the points contained in the set and not on the boundary. \\

    $S_{interior} = \{ x \in \R^2 | -1 < x_{i} < 1, i = 1,2 \}$

    \item $S_{boudary}$ is defined to be $\bar{S} - S$. Such that... \\
    $S_{boudary} = \{ x\in\R^2 | \: x_{i} = -1 \text{ or } x_{i} =1, i = 1,2 \}$
\end{enumerate}
