\section*{Problem \#1}
Consider a single-input-single-output system described by the nth-order differential equation.

\[ y^{(n)} = g_{1} \left(t, y, \dot{y}, ... ,y^{(n-1), u}  \right) + g_{2} \left( t, y, \dot{y}, ... ,y^{(n-2)}\right)\dot{u}   \]

where $g_{2}$ is a differentialable function of its arguments. With $u$ as input and $y$ as output, find the state-space model. Hint: $x_{n} = y^{(n-1)} - g_{2} \left( t, y, \dot{y}, ..., y^{n-2}\right)$ \\

\textbf{Solution:} The first step is to define the state variables and then to determine the state-space model by constructing the $n-th$ first-order ODE system as follows...\\

State Definitions:
\begin{flalign*}
    & x_{1} = y \\
    & x_{2} = \dot{y} \\
    & \vdots \\
    & x_{n-2} = y^{n-3} \\
    & x_{n-1} = y^{n-2}\\
    & x_{n} = y^{n-1} - g_{2} \left( t, y, \dot{y}, ..., y^{n-2}\right) \\
\end{flalign*}

State Derivative Definitions:
\begin{flalign*}
    & \dot{x_{1}} = x_{2} \\
    & \dot{x_{2}} = x_{3} \\
    & \vdots \\
    & \dot{x}_{n-1} = y^{n-1}\\
    & \dot{x}_{n} = y^{n} - g_{2} \left( t, y, \dot{y}, \cdots , y^{n-2}\right)\dot{u} - \left( \frac{\partial g_2}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial g_2}{\partial x_1} \cdot \frac{\partial x_1}{\partial t} + \cdots \frac{\partial g_2}{\partial x_{n-1}} \cdot \frac{\partial x_n}{\partial t} \right) u\\
\end{flalign*}

\noindent Where the final derivative $\dot{x}_{n}$ is found by using the chain rule on the expression for $x_{n}$, since $g_2$ is a differentiable function. To accomplish this, we can expand the derivative using the product rule of differentiation, to obtain the final form of $\dot{x}_{n}$.
