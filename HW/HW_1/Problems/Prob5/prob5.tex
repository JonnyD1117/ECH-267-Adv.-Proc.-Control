\section*{Problem \#5}

Given the following equation over $[0, \infty)$...

$$
\dot{x}(t) = [x(t)]^{\frac{1}{3}} \hspace{.3cm}, x(0) =0\\
$$

\noindent We can show that this problem has a \textbf{NOT unique} solution, via the ``Existance and Uniqueness Theorem''. \\

\noindent This theorem states that if the function and its derivative are continuous around the initial condition of the system that there exists a unique solution. \\

\noindent $\dot{x} = f(x)$ is a continuous function on the inteveral \textbf{not} including the origin, however, when taking the derivative of the function $f(x)$, we note that it is \textbf{not continuous} at $x=0$ where the function become undefined, according to the limit definition of a derivate. Since the limit approaching from the left and right do not agree, the derivative must not exist. Therefore we cannot say that the solution is unique due to the inclusion of the origin in the domain of the problem.
