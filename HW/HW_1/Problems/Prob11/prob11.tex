\section*{Problem \#11}

For $x = \R^{n}$ ...

\noindent Given norm equivalence ...
$$ c\left\Vert x \right\Vert_{a} \leq \left\Vert x \right\Vert_{b} \leq d \left\Vert x \right\Vert_{a} $$

\subsection*{11.1}
For the problem ...

$$ \left\Vert x \right\Vert_{2} \leq \left\Vert x \right\Vert_{1} \leq \sqrt{n} \left\Vert x \right\Vert_{2} $$

\noindent From the statement of the norm equivalence it is clear that there exist norms such that $a=2$ and $b=1$ and that constants $c=1$ and $d=\sqrt{n}$ exist and satisfy the inequality.

\subsection*{11.2}

For the problem ...

$$ \left\Vert x \right\Vert_{\infty} \leq \left\Vert x \right\Vert_{2} \leq \sqrt{n} \left\Vert x \right\Vert_{\infty} $$

\noindent Similar to the previous problem, we can show through norm equivalence that for $a=\infty$ and $b=2$ and that constants $c=1$ and $d=\sqrt{n}$ exist and satisfy the inequality.

\subsection*{11.3}

For the problem ...

$$ \left\Vert x \right\Vert_{\infty} \leq \left\Vert x \right\Vert_{1} \leq \sqrt{n} \left\Vert x \right\Vert_{\infty} $$

\noindent Similar to the previous problem, we can show through norm equivalence that for $a=\infty$ and $b=2$ and that constants $c=1$ and $d=n$ exist and satisfy the inequality.
