Let $f(x)$ be continuously differentiable. Show that an equilibrium point $x^* = f(x)$ is isolated if the Jacobian matrix $[ \partial f /\partial x ](x^*)$ is nonsingular. \\

\noindent \underline{\textbf{Solution:}} \\

\noindent According to the \underline{implicit function theorem}, if the Jacobian matrix is \textbf{invertible} (aka if its deteminant is not equal to zero), then there exists an open set $ U \subset \R^n$ containing a point $a$ such that there exists a unique continuously differentiable function $g:U\rightarrow \R^m$ such that$g(a) = b$, and that $f(x,g(x)) = 0 \quad \forall x \in U$. \\

\noindent This states that if the Jacobian is nonsingular then we can infer that there exists a unique equilibrium point ($x^*$) such that the function equals zero.
