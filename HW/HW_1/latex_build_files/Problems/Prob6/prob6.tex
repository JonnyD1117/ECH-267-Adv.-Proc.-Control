    For each of the following systems, find all equilibrium points and determine the type of each isloated equilibrium.

    \subsection*{Part 6.1}


    \begin{flalign*}
        & \dot{x}_{1} = x_{2} \\
        & \dot{x}_{2} = -x_{1} + \frac{x^{3}_{1}}{6} -x_{2}\\
    \end{flalign*}

    We can determine the equilibrium points of the system by setting the state equations equal to zero and solving.

    \begin{flalign*}
        & 0 = x_{2} \\
        & 0 = -x_{1} + \frac{x^{3}_{1}}{6} -x_{2}\\
    \end{flalign*}

    Which yields the following equilibrium points.

    \begin{flalign*}
        & P_{1} = (0,0) \\
        & P_{2} = (\sqrt{6}, 0 ) \\
        & P_{3} = (-\sqrt{6}, 0 ) \\
    \end{flalign*}

    These equilibria can be used to derive a linearized system to indentify the `type' of the equilibrium point.

    $$
    \begin{matrix}
        & \frac{\partial f_{1}}{\partial x_{1}} = 0 & \frac{\partial f_{1}}{\partial x_{2}} = 1 \\
        & \frac{\partial f_{2}}{\partial x_{1}} = \left( -1 + \frac{3x_{1}^{2}}{6} \right) & \frac{\partial f_{2}}{\partial x_{2}} = -1
    \end{matrix}
    $$

    Therefore for $P_1$, we can define the jacobian matrix $A_j$ as ...

    $$ A_j =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        0 & 1 \\
        -1 & -1
    \end{bmatrix}\Big|_{P_1}
    $$

    where the eigenvalues of the linearized system are $\lambda_{P_{1}} = -.5 \pm .866j$. Therefore the linearization of this system about $P_1$ yields a \textbf{Stable Focus}.


Therefore for $P_2$, we can define the jacobian matrix $A_j$ as ...

$$ A_j =
\begin{bmatrix}
    0 & 1 \\
    2 & -1
\end{bmatrix}\Big|_{P_2}
$$

where the eigenvalues of the linearized system are $\lambda_{P_{2}} = 1, -2$. Therefore the linearization of this system about $P_2$ yields a \textbf{saddle point}.

In a similar manner for $P_3$, we can define the jacobian matrix $A_j$ as ...

$$ A_j =
\begin{bmatrix}
    0 & 1 \\
    2 & -1
\end{bmatrix}\Big|_{P_3}
$$

where the eigenvalues of the linearized system are $\lambda_{P_{3}} = 1, -2$. Therefore the linearization of this system about $P_3$ yields a \textbf{saddle point}.










\subsection*{Part 6.2}

    \[ \dot{x}_{1} = -x_{1} + x_{2}\]
    \[  \dot{x}_{2} = 0.1x_{1} - 2x_{2} - x_{1}^{2} - 0.1x_{1}^{3}\]

    We can determine the equilibrium points of the system by setting the state equations equal to zero and solving.

    \begin{flalign*}
        & 0 =-x_{1} + x_{2} \\
        & 0 = 0.1x_{1} - 2x_{2} - x_{1}^{2} - 0.1x_{1}^{3}\\
    \end{flalign*}

    Which yields the following equilibrium points.

    \begin{flalign*}
        & P_{1} = (0,0) \\
        & P_{2} = (x_1, x_2 = -7.44949 ) \\
        & P_{3} = (x_1, x_2 = -2.55051) \\
    \end{flalign*}

    These equilibria can be used to derive a linearized system to indentify the `type' of the equilibrium point.

    $$
    \begin{matrix}
        & \frac{\partial f_{1}}{\partial x_{1}} = -1 & \frac{\partial f_{1}}{\partial x_{2}} = 1 \\
        & \frac{\partial f_{2}}{\partial x_{1}} = \left( .1 - 2x_{1} -.3x_{1}^2 \right) & \frac{\partial f_{2}}{\partial x_{2}} = -2
    \end{matrix}
    $$

    Therefore for $P_1$, we can define the jacobian matrix $A_j$ as ...

    $$ A_j =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        -1 & 1 \\
        .1 & -2
    \end{bmatrix}\Big|_{P_1}
    $$

    where the eigenvalues of the linearized system are $\lambda_{P_{1}} = -.9084, -2.0916$. Therefore the linearization of this system about $P_1$ yields a \textbf{Stable Node}.


    Therefore for $P_2$, we can define the jacobian matrix $A_j$ as ...

    $$ A_j =
    \begin{bmatrix}
    -1 & 1 \\
    1.6494 & -2
    \end{bmatrix}\Big|_{P_2}
    $$

    where the eigenvalues of the linearized system are $\lambda_{P_{2}} = -.1218, -2.8782$. Therefore the linearization of this system about $P_2$ yields a \textbf{Stable Node}.

    In a similar manner for $P_3$, we can define the jacobian matrix $A_j$ as ...

    $$ A_j =
    \begin{bmatrix}
    -1 & 1 \\
    3.2494 & -2
    \end{bmatrix}\Big|_{P_3}
    $$

    where the eigenvalues of the linearized system are $\lambda_{P_{3}} = .3707, -3.3707 $. Therefore the linearization of this system about $P_3$ yields a \textbf{saddle point}.


    \subsection*{Part 6.3}

    \[ \dot{x}_{1} = (1-x_1)x_1 - \frac{2x_{1}x_{2}}{1 + x_1} \]
    \[  \dot{x}_{2} = \left( 2 - \frac{x_{2}}{1 + x_{1}} \right) x_{2}\]


    We can determine the equilibrium points of the system by setting the state equations equal to zero and solving.

    \begin{flalign*}
        & 0 = (1-x_1)x_1 - \frac{2x_{1}x_{2}}{1 + x_1} \\
        & 0 = \left( 2 - \frac{x_{2}}{1 + x_{1}} \right) x_{2}\\
    \end{flalign*}

    Which yields the following equilibrium points.

    \begin{flalign*}
        & P_{1} = (0,0) \\
        & P_{2} = (x_1 = -3, x_2 = -4 ) \\
    \end{flalign*}

    These equilibria can be used to derive a linearized system to indentify the `type' of the equilibrium point.

    Therefore for $P_1$, we can define the jacobian matrix $A_j$ as ...

    $$ A_j =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        1 & 0 \\
        0 & 2
    \end{bmatrix}\Big|_{P_1}
    $$

    where the eigenvalues of the linearized system are $\lambda_{P_{1}} = 1, 2$. Therefore the linearization of this system about $P_1$ yields a \textbf{Unstable Node}.


    Therefore for $P_2$, we can define the jacobian matrix $A_j$ as ...

    $$ A_j =
    \begin{bmatrix}
    9 & -3 \\
    -4 & -2
    \end{bmatrix}\Big|_{P_2}
    $$

    where the eigenvalues of the linearized system are $\lambda_{P_{2}} = 10, -3$. Therefore the linearization of this system about $P_2$ yields a \textbf{Saddle Point}.

    \[  \dot{x}_{2} = -x_{1} + x_{2} \left( 1 - 3x_{1}^{2} -2x_{2}^{2} \right)\]


    We can determine the equilibrium points of the system by setting the state equations equal to zero and solving.

    \begin{flalign*}
        & 0 = x_{2} \\
        & 0 = -x_{1} + x_{2} \left( 1 - 3x_{1}^{2} -2x_{2}^{2} \right)\\
    \end{flalign*}
