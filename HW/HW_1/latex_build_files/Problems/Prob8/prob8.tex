\subsection*{Part A}

After applying Linearization to given system, using a first order Taylor Exspansion, we show that the system produces the following partial derivatives, which will be used to construct the Jacobian matrix for the system.

\begin{flalign*}
  & \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_1} = \frac{x_{1} x_{2}}{{\ln\left(\sqrt{{x_{1}}^2+{x_{2}}^2}\right)}^2\left({x_{1}}^2+{x_{2}}^2\right)}-1 \\
  & \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_2} = \frac{{x_{2}}^2}{{\ln\left(\sqrt{{x_{1}}^2+{x_{2}}^2}\right)}^2 \left({x_{1}}^2+{x_{2}}^2\right)}-\frac{1}{\ln\left(\sqrt{{x_{1}}^2+{x_{2}}^2}\right)} \\
  & \frac{\partial f_2}{\partial x_1} = \frac{1}{\ln\left(\sqrt{{x_{1}}^2+{x_{2}}^2}\right)}-\frac{{x_{1}}^2}{{\ln\left(\sqrt{{x_{1}}^2+{x_{2}}^2}\right)}^2 \left({x_{1}}^2+{x_{2}}^2\right)} \\
  & \frac{\partial f_2}{\partial x_2} =-\frac{x_{1} x_{2}}{{\ln\left(\sqrt{{x_{1}}^2+{x_{2}}^2}\right)}^2\left({x_{1}}^2+{x_{2}}^2\right)}-1 \\
\end{flalign*}

\noindent After performing these calculations, and eveluating the system at its $x_eq = (0, 0)$, we can constuct the Jacobian matrix $ A_j$ such that the linear system can be written as...

$$
\dot{x} = A_j \cdot x
$$

\noindent Where the Jacobian is defined as...

$$
A_j =
\begin{bmatrix}
  -0.8693 & 0.6419 \\
  -0.6419 & -1.1307
\end{bmatrix}
$$

\noindent By taking the eigenvalues of the linearized systen (described by $A_j$), we can attempt to asses local stability of the system.

$$
\text{eigenvalue} = -1.0000 \pm 0.6285i
$$

\noindent Since the `real' component of the eigenvalue is in the left-half of the complex plane, than we would presume that the system is \underline{stable}; however, since the eigenvalues are complex, this means that the linearized system would indicate that the equilibrium point is a \underline{\textbf{stable focus}}.
