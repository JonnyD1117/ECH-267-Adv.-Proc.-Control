\section*{Problem 4}

Use $V(x) = x_1^2 + x_2^2$ to study the stability of the origin of the system.

$$
\begin{array}{l}
\dot{x}_{1}=x_{1}\left(k^{2}-x_{1}^{2}-x_{2}^{2}\right)+x_{2}\left(x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+k^{2}\right) \\
\dot{x}_{2}=-x_{1}\left(k^{2}+x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}\right)+x_{2}\left(k^{2}-x_{1}^{2}-x_{2}^{2}\right)
\end{array}
$$

\noindent We can compute $\dot{V}(s)$ from the given Lyapunov candidate to be ...

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{l}
V(x)=x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2} \\
\dot{V}(x)=2 x_{1} \dot{x}_{1}+2 x_{2} \dot{x}_{2} \\
\quad \quad \: \:= 2 x_{1}\left(x_{1}\left[k^{2}-x_{1}^{2}-x_{2}^{2}\right]+x_{2}\left[x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+k^{2}\right]\right)+\ldots \\
\ldots+2 x_{2}\left(-x_{1}\left[k^{2}+x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}\right]+x_{2}\left[k-x_{1}^{2}-x_{2}\right]\right)
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\noindent We can reduce that expression as follows...

$$
\dot{V}(x) = \left( 2x_1^2 + 2x_2^2 \right) \left[ k^2 - x_1^2 -x_2^2 \right]
$$

\noindent The first term in this expression is clearly positive definite $\forall x\in \R^2$. Therefore in order to determine the stability of the system, we must look at the second term and determine its behavior for the arbitrary constant $k$. The two cases for $k$ are written below.

\subsubsection*{Case: $K = 0$}

In order to garuntee that $\dot{V}(x) < 0 $, we must show that the term $k^2 - x_1^2 -x_2^2 \leq 0 $. For the cases when $k = 0$. It is clear that the term $-x_1^2 - x_2^2$ is \textbf{must} be negative definite $\forall x \in \R^2$. Therefore the system is \textbf{globally asymptotically stable} when $k = 0$, due to the fact that system time derivative of the Lyapunov function is negative definite $\forall x \in \R^2$, according to Lyapunov Global Stability Theorem.


\subsubsection*{Case: $K \neq 0$}

\noindent For the case when $x \neq 0 $, we must garuntee that the term $k^2 - x_1^2 -x_2^2 \leq 0 $. By substituting the expression for the candidate function into this derivate form ...
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{l}
  k^2 - x_1^2 -x_2^2 \leq 0 \\
 k^2 - (x_1^2 +x_2^2) \leq 0 \\
 k^2 - V(x) < 0 \\
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\noindent Such that...

$$
V < k^2
$$

\noindent This restrictions shows that there is some restriction on the state space in order to maintain the inequality. This infer that the system is \textbf{asymptotically stable}, but that the system cannot be globally asymptotically stable since by this very condition there exist limits on the function where its derivative are no longer negative definite.
