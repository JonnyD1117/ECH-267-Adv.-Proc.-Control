\section*{Problem 17}


For each of the following systems, use lineraization to show that the origin is aymptotically stable. Then sxhow that the origin is globally asymptoticially stable.

\subsection*{Part 1}
$$
\begin{array}{l}
\dot{x}_{1}=-x_{1}+x_{2} \\
\dot{x}_{2}=\left(x_{1}+x_{2}\right) \sin x_{1}-3 x_{2}
\end{array}
$$


\noindent To linearize the system we need to take its Jacobian.


$$
A_j =
\begin{bmatrix}
  \frac{\partial f_{1}}{\partial x_{1}} & \frac{\partial f_{1}}{\partial x_{1}} & \\

  \frac{\partial f_{2}}{\partial x_{1}} & \frac{\partial f_{2}}{\partial x_{2}}&
\end{bmatrix}
=
\left .
\begin{bmatrix}

-1 & 1 & \\

  sin(x_1) + x_1cos(x_1 + x_2cos(x_2))  & \sin (x)-3&

\end{bmatrix} \right\rvert_{x=0}
$$


\noindent After evaluating the system at its origin, we can show that...

$$
A = \begin{bmatrix}
-1 & 1 & \\
0 & -3 &
\end{bmatrix}
$$


\noindent Since the eigenvalues of this system are $\lambda_1 = -1$ and $\lambda_2 = -3$ we can conclude that locally this system is \underline{stable}.











\subsection*{Part 2}


$$
\begin{array}{l}
\dot{x}_{1}=-x_{1}^{3}+x_{2} \\
\dot{x}_{2}=-a x_{1}-b x_{2}, a, b>0
\end{array}
$$



$$
A_j =
\begin{bmatrix}
  \frac{\partial f_{1}}{\partial x_{1}} & \frac{\partial f_{1}}{\partial x_{1}} & \\

  \frac{\partial f_{2}}{\partial x_{1}} & \frac{\partial f_{2}}{\partial x_{2}}&
\end{bmatrix}
=
\left .
\begin{bmatrix}

-3x_1 & 1 & \\

-a  & -b &

\end{bmatrix} \right\rvert_{x=0}
$$



\noindent By taking the eigenvalues of this Jacobian we can determine the local stability condition of the system. These are given by $\lambda_{1,2} = .5\pm .886j $, when the constant a and b equal 1. Therefore the system is a \underline{stable focus}. \\


\noindent We can show that this is globally asymptoticially stable, using a standard quadratic Lyapunov candidate function.

$$
V(x) = \frac{1}{2}x_1^2 + \frac{1}{2}x_2^2
$$

\noindent Whose time derivative is...

$$
\dot{V}(x) = x_1\dot{x_1} + x_2\dot{x_2}
$$

\noindent After substituting in the state equations...

$$
\dot{V}(x) = -x_1^4 + x_1x_2 - ax_1x_2 - bx_2^2
$$


\noindent Note that if the constants $a$ and $b$ both equal 1, then the Lyapunov function reduces to..

$$
\dot{V}(x) = -x_1^4 -x_2^2
$$

\noindent Since this function is negative definite, and since the candidate function is positive definite and radially unbounded we can say that according to the Global Lyapunov stability theorem that the system must be \underline{globally asymptotically stable} about the origin.
