\section*{Problem 7}



$$
\begin{array}{l}
\dot{x}_{1}=-x_{1}+x_{2} \\
\dot{x}_{2}=\left(x_{1}+x_{2}\right) \sin x_{1}-3 x_{2}
\end{array}
$$


\subsection*{Part A}

In order to determine whether the origin is a \underline{unique equilibrium point}, we must determine all possible equilibrium points of the system by setting the state equations equal to zero, such that...

$$
\begin{array}{l}
0 =-x_{1}+x_{2} \\
0 =\left(x_{1}+x_{2}\right) \sin x_{1}-3 x_{2}
\end{array}
$$

\noindent This expression simplifies to...

$$
\begin{array}{l}
x_{1}=x_{2} \\
0=\left[2 x_{2} \sin \left(x_{1}\right)-3 x_{2}\right]\left(\frac{1}{x_{2}}\right) \\
\end{array}
$$


\noindent After substituting the first state state equation in the second we get...

$$
0=2 \sin \left(x_{1}\right)-3
$$

\noindent Which reduces to ...

$$
\frac{3}{2} = sin(x_1)
$$

\subsubsection*{Solution}: In order to solve for equilibrium points (other than the origin) there must exist solutions to the previous equations. However the $Sine$ function is bouded by $[-1, 1]]$. This means that it is impossible for there to exist a solution which satisfies this expression. Therefore the origin is a \underline{\textbf{unique equilibrium point}}.


\subsection*{Part B}

To linearize the system, we must determine the Jacobian of the given system about the equilibrium point...

$$
A_j =
\begin{bmatrix}
  \frac{\partial f_{1}}{\partial x_{1}} & \frac{\partial f_{1}}{\partial x_{1}} & \\

  \frac{\partial f_{2}}{\partial x_{1}} & \frac{\partial f_{2}}{\partial x_{2}}&
\end{bmatrix}
=
\left .
\begin{bmatrix}

-1 & 1 & \\

  sin(x_1) + x_1cos(x_1 + x_2cos(x_2))  & \sin (x)-3&

\end{bmatrix} \right\rvert_{x=0}
$$


\noindent After evaluating the system at its origin, we can show that...

$$
A = \begin{bmatrix}
-1 & 1 & \\
0 & -3 &
\end{bmatrix}
$$

\noindent By taking the eigenvalues of this matrix, we can see that the matrix is \underline{Hurwitz}, since it yields the following eigenvalues $\lambda_1 = -1$ and $\lambda_2 = -3$ in which both exist in the left half side of the complex plane.
