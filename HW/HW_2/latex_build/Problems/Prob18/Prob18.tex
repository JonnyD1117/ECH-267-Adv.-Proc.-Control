\section*{Problem 18}



$$
\dot{X}(t) = \frac{-x}{t+1} \quad \forall t \geq 0
$$

\noindent We can solve this equation directly using integration. This leads to...


$$
x(t)  = x(t_0) = exp\left( \int_{t_0}^t \frac{-1}{1 + \tau} d\tau \right)
$$



$$
\frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{-x}{1 + t}
$$



$$
\int_{x_{0}}^{x} \frac{d x}{x}=\int_{t_{0}}^{t}\left(\frac{-1}{1+t}\right) d t
$$



$$
\left.\ln (x)\right|_{x_{0}} ^{x}=\left(\int_{t_{0}}^{t} \frac{-1}{1+\tau} d \tau\right)
$$


$$
X(t)=x\left(t_{0}\right) \exp \left\{\left(\int_{-\infty}^{t} \frac{-1}{1+\tau} d \tau\right)\right\}
$$



\noindent Using this solution, we can say that the any trajectory in the system will ...


$$
x(t) = x(t_0)e^{-\alpha}
$$

\noindent We know that due to the sign of the exponent in the solution of the problem that the system must be decaying over time... such that


$$
|x(t)| \leq |x(t_0)|
$$

\noindent This means that the solution is \underline{stable} for all $t \geq 0$; however, if we want to determine global stability we must demonstrate that the system $X(t) \rightarrow 0$ as $t \rightarrow \infty $. In order to show these, we can perform the integral in the exponent of the previous solution and then analyze the system at $t=\infty$.

$$
x(t) = x(t_0)\left[\frac{1+ t_0}{1 + t} \right] = 0 \quad \quad t \rightarrow \infty
$$


\noindent Using this solution, we can clearly see that the value of $x$ trends towards zero as time trends towards infinity. Because of this, we can conclude that the system is \underline{globally asymptoticially stable}.
