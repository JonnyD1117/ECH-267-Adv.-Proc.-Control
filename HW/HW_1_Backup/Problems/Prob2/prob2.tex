\section*{Problem \#2}

Given the block diagram of the system, we can define the following expressions and substitute them together with the standard linear state-space model to arrive at the new closed loop state-space model, as a function of $\psi(t, y)$.


    $$\dot{x} = A x + Bu $$
    $$y = Cx + Du $$

\noindent From the block diagram, it is obvious that the control input is defined as follows.
$$ u = r - \psi(t,y) $$

\noindent By substituting this expression for the control input, we can derive the final state-space form of...

$$  \dot{x} = Ax + B\left( r - \psi(t,y) \right) $$
$$ y = Cx + D(r - \psi(t,y)) $$
