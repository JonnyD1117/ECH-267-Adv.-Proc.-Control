\section*{Problem \#4}

Consider the mass-spring system shown in Figure 3. Assuming a linear spring and nonlinear viscous damping described by $ c_{1}\dot{y} + c_{2}\dot{y}|\dot{y}|$, find a state equation that describes the motion of the system. \\



\textbf{Solution:} The force of linear spring is $F_{s} = kX$, the force of gravity is $ W=mg$, and the force due to damping is provided in the problem statement. By using Newton's second law, we can combine these quantities in a force balance as follows, given the mass $m$, the spring constant $k$, the acceleration due to gravity $g$, and finally the damping constants $C_{1}$ and $ C_{2}$.

$$ m\ddot{y} = k*y + c_{1}\dot{y} + c_{2}\dot{y}|\dot{y}| -mg $$

Given the state variables $x_{1}$ and $ x_{2}$ defined as follows...

\[ x_{1} = y \]
\[ x_{2} = \dot{y} \]

We arrive at the following state space equation...

\[ \dot{x_{1}} = x_{2}\]
\[ \dot{x_{2}} = \left( \frac{k}{m} \right)x_{1}  + \left[ c_{1}x_{2} + c_{2}x_{2}|x_{2}| \right]  \left( \frac{1}{m} \right) -g \]
