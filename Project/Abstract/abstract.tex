    \section{Overview}

    The objective of this project is to implement an optimal Path/Trajectory Planner using the Model Predictive Control (MPC) formulation, for a simplified robotic arm/manipulator. The responsibility of the MPC will be to generate the `optimal' path, from a specified starting waypoint to a specified ending waypoint. This formulation should be able to use MPC as online means of generating optimal paths, in real-time, as well as avoid obstacles, which might exist in the robots workspace.
